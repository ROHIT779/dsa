## Navigation System
Problem Statement: We have a map of different places and their connecting routes. We need to find the quickest routes to visit from one place to another. 
Additionally if there are blockages in some routes, we need to find the quickest routes avoiding the blocked routes.  
Solution: Graph data structure is used to construct the map and Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the quickest routes between different places. A user interface in linux terminal is created to interact with the application. Arrays, Priority Queue and Java are used.
